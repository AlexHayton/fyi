# EAS Update

EAS Update is a hosted service that serves updates for projects using the expo-updates library.

It makes fixing small bugs and pushing quick fixes a snap in between app store submissions. It accomplishes this by allowing an end-user's app to swap out the non-native parts of their app (for example, JS, styling, and image changes) with a new update that contains bug fixes and other updates.

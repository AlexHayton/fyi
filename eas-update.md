# EAS Update

EAS Update is a service that will allow developers to deploy updates to builds that are currently running on end-user's devices. Our goal is to make iterating on your project incredibly fast and easy. With EAS Update, you'll be able to:

- Take advantage of new, more stable release flows that will allow you to deploy in milliseconds.
- Roll out updates incrementally.
- Preview every change with Expo Go or a custom dev client, across your organization.
- View and manage updates in a website interface.
- Automatically publish new updates with CI actions.
- Customize when your end-users receive updates.

# Enabling web service workers

Expo's Webpack config has all the required plugins for building a [progressive web app](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/), but the offline support is **disabled** by default.

To enable offline support you can do the following:

- Eject the Webpack config:
  - Run `expo customize:web`
  - Select `webpack.config.js`
- Modify the config file and pass the option `offline: true` to the creator method.

```js
const createExpoWebpackConfigAsync = require("@expo/webpack-config");

module.exports = async function (env, argv) {
  const config = await createExpoWebpackConfigAsync(
    {
      ...env,
      // Passing true will enable the default Workbox + Expo SW configuration.
      offline: true,
    },
    argv
  );
  // Customize the config before returning it.
  return config;
};
```

- For more info on how service workers are setup in Expo or how you can customize the Workbox plugin, see this doc [@expo/webpack-config#service-workers](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/tree/master/packages/webpack-config#service-workers)

## Considerations

- Offline support can be confusing for many because the website will only update if all tabs and windows with your website are closed. Often it's easier to just force refresh (âŒ˜+R).
- Service workers can only be run from a [secure origin (https)](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers#you_need_https). This doesn't apply to `localhost`.
- The service worker will be disabled in development mode. You can test it by building the project locally `expo build:web` and running the project from a local https server.

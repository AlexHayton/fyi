# Bumping Android Version Code

#### ðŸ¤” What Happened

If you're submitting your Android app to Google Play Store using the `expo upload:android` command, you may encouter the following error:

> You've already submitted this version of the app.<br>
> Versions are identified by Android version code (expo.android.versionCode in app.json).<br>
> If you're submitting a managed Expo project, increment the version code in app.json and build the project with expo build:android.

#### ðŸ’¡ Solution

1. Increment the value for the `expo.android.versionCode` key in `app.json`. Optionally, commit this change. Then, build a new app archive with `expo build:android`. Wait for the build to finish.

2. Run `expo upload:android --use-submission-service` to upload your app to Google Play Store. Wait for the submission to complete.

3. You can verify that the app has been submitted by visiting [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/).

# EAS Project ID

Each project on Expo Application Services (EAS) has a unique ID. This ID is used to link the project between your local development environment and the EAS API. The project ID is stored in your app config (**app.json** or **app.config.js**) under the `extra.eas.projectId` key. The project ID never changes, even if the project is transferred to a different account. A project ID is associated with a single slug, which cannot be changed.
